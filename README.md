# Quick Short

### What is this?

This is a Rails gem for creating local short urls with no lookup.
Its awesome.

The idea is pretty simple.  Instead of using a short ID lookup table, we change the base of the primary key and use it as a short_id.

### Requirements

* Models you want to use this with must have a single, numeric primary key

### Coming Soon

* Anchor tag shortening

### Naming

yes, the name is a play on 'quick sort'

### Authors

* John Crepezzi
